Android Job Portal System

# Background/ Problem Statement

An employment portal is an application that facilitates the search for employment and ranges from large, generalized sites to specialized working groups for work categories such as engineering, law, insurance, social work, teaching, and developing mobile applications. 
Users can usually submit their resumes and send them to potential employers and recruiters for review, while employers and recruiters can post job postings and search for potential employees. Niche job directories begin to play a bigger role in providing jobs and employees with more goals for the candidate or employer.
Our android-based Job Portal System will provide a very specific way to eliminate and reduce the time for the most appropriate role. The determination is to allow communication between the interested parties and complete the task of recruitment quickly.

# Working of the Project

Recruitment is often reported in the literature as the process of analyzing the job requirements, pooling together a network of qualified candidates, and hiring the best-fit person for the role in order to gain a competitive advantage. Selection is the process of choosing the best-fit person for the role from the generated pool of qualified candidates. 
A job portal is a platform dedicated to online information about recruiters as well as job seekers. A job portal helps both job seekers and recruiters find the right organization for the employees. In the case of job seekers, according to their educational qualification, experience, and their preferences, the job portal shows the list of companies to the job seeker. And, to the recruiters, provides the suitable candidates from a pool of lacks. 
The objective of the Job Portal System is to develop a system to enable interaction between employers and applicants. In this project, the front-end involves XML, Android-Java and the back-end involves MSSQL. The IDE used is Android Studio.
